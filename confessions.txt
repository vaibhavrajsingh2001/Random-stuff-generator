For Sanjeevni Deol: "I think about you in every moment and every image of you hurts me horribly. I want to feel every thought, every whisper you say in the deep silence of the eternity of you soul. To be able to cry in me, beside you, beside me in you, to be able to understand why our hearts beat, why we live among moments and not among eternities as if it were different. To be able to understand every smile which breaks in my just like a wave, which finally breaks against the cliff of my eternity through the blood of my ancestors as my misconducts break in your eternity and that of your ancestors.And they want to tell you how much I love you, how much I adore you in this vain world. I know we will never be able to look in the eyes, but only in the hearts.I know they beat against the infinite precisely because they beat even though we both want the infinite and its truth. Any beat opposes the infinite because it measures an infinity, even if it is finite. And then?"

For Setu Kaur: "True love is like ghosts, which everybody talks about and few have seen."

For Manjari Haldar: "A simple I love you means more than money."
For Mithilesh Khurana: "It's a real kind of love without being all sloppy and sentimental, which I think people can

For Nalinikant Madan: "There is always some madness in love. But there is also always some reason in madness."
For Pooja Mallick: "Romantic love, in pornography as in life, is the mythic celebration of female negation. For a woman, love is defined as her willingness to submit to her own annihilation. The proof of love is that she is willing 
to be destroyed by the one whom she loves, for his sake. For the woman, love is always self-sacrifice, the sacrifice of identity, will, and bodily integrity, in order to fulfill and redeem the masculinity of her lover."
For Sarvin Naidu: "I love my wife, she deserves anything and everything."
For Uttam Puri: "Love, you know, seeks to make happy rather than to be happy."

For Sunita Khanna: "Two lives, two hearts joined together in friendship united forever in love."
